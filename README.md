- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, 
- 
- My name is Warren. 
- It's not my intention to make anything I put on github public. 
- So, if you're reading this it's because either I've changed my mind or I've screwed something up, most likely the latter.
- But, if somehow you did wind up here and are interested in knowing what I'm interested in. Here's a brief list.
-   - Teaching mathematics at the university level and developing software to support the teaching.
-   - Teaching mathematics at the K-12 levels and developing software to support the teaching.
-   - Current events
-   - World and American history.
